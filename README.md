**Linear Regression for Estimating CO2 Emissions of Cars**

Linear regression is a widely used technique for estimating the CO2 emissions of cars based on various input variables like engine size, fuel efficiency, and other vehicle characteristics.In this repo we will be working on Simple Linear Regression model to predict the emission of CO2 based on one prediction feature.

_**Follow these steps to create a linear regression model for estimating CO2 emissions of cars:

**Gather Data:** Collect data on CO2 emissions and relevant input variables from various sources like manufacturers, government agencies, or online databases.I have taken it from a canadian website.

**Prepare and Understand Data:** Clean the data by removing missing values and outliers. Normalize or standardize the input variables if needed.

**Split Data:** Divide the data into a training set and a testing set for training and evaluating the model's performance. ( **Train/Test Split** method followed )

**Select Features:** Choose the input variables that are most strongly correlated with CO2 emissions.

**Define the Model:** Create a linear regression model that maps the input features to CO2 emissions using an equation:

CO2 Emissions = b0 + b1 * Input Feature 1 + b2 * Input Feature 2 + ... + bn * Input Feature n

where b0 is the intercept and b1, b2, ..., bn are the coefficients for each input feature.

**Train the Model:** Fit the model to the training data using a suitable algorithm such as ordinary least squares regression.

**Evaluate the Model:** Use the testing set to evaluate the model's performance by calculating metrics such as mean squared error, mean absolute error, or R-squared.

**Improve the Model:** Try to improve the model's performance by adding more input features, using a different algorithm, or tuning hyperparameters.

**Use the Model:** Once you are satisfied with the model's performance, you can use it to make predictions on new data.

Note that linear regression assumes a linear relationship between the input features and the output variable. If the relationship is non-linear, you may need to use more advanced techniques such as polynomial regression or neural networks.

Linear Regression for Estimating CO2 Emissions of Cars
Linear regression is a widely used technique for estimating the CO2 emissions of cars based on various input variables like engine size, fuel efficiency, and other vehicle characteristics.

Follow these steps to create a linear regression model for estimating CO2 emissions of cars:

Gather Data: Collect data on CO2 emissions and relevant input variables from various sources like manufacturers, government agencies, or online databases.

Prepare Data: Clean the data by removing missing values and outliers. Normalize or standardize the input variables if needed.

Split Data: Divide the data into a training set and a testing set for training and evaluating the model's performance.

Select Features: Choose the input variables that are most strongly correlated with CO2 emissions.

Define the Model: Create a linear regression model that maps the input features to CO2 emissions using an equation:

CO2 Emissions = b0 + b1 * Input Feature 1 + b2 * Input Feature 2 + ... + bn * Input Feature n

where b0 is the intercept and b1, b2, ..., bn are the coefficients for each input feature.

Train the Model: Fit the model to the training data using a suitable algorithm such as ordinary least squares regression.

Evaluate the Model: Use the testing set to evaluate the model's performance by calculating metrics such as mean squared error, mean absolute error, or R-squared.

Improve the Model: Try to improve the model's performance by adding more input features, using a different algorithm, or tuning hyperparameters.

Use the Model: Once you are satisfied with the model's performance, you can use it to make predictions on new data.

Note that linear regression assumes a linear relationship between the input features and the output variable. If the relationship is non-linear, you may need to use more advanced techniques such as polynomial regression or neural networks.
